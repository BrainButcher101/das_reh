The Nexus is a repository that will help us to highlight open topics and enable collaboration in the broader community. 

In this short memo, we'd like to outline the starting constraints for the Nexus, 
leaving room to future adjustments and fine-tuning. Our focus is creating a functional collaboration across topics in the next 
few weeks, embracing its initial imperfections. Improvement proposals are, as always, more than welcome.


# Purpose

The purpose of Nexus is to

* Provide the **technical guidance and decisions** required to smoothly operate Cyber. This typically includes cross-team decisions, breaking up of large projects, high-level estimates for roadmap initiatives etc.
* **Manage the evolution** of the Cyber platform
* **Manage the technical evolution** aligned with the broader PagoNxt Architecture Framework
* **Ensure transparency** of technological outcomes and initiatives to increase efficiency


# Organization

## Structure
The Nexus will be organized and governed by the appointed Cyber CTOs in close alignment with the local CISOs and HoldCo. 


# Processes

## Requests
All cyber employees can send their requests to Nexus by opening an Issue.

An initiative / issue becomes live once a pull request from a branch into master happened. 

Cyber employees are free to organize their response as they see fit. In the bi-weekly CISO meeting we will conduct a breif review 
and create awareness in the teams if needed.
